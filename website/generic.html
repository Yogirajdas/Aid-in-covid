							<p>The COViD-19 Pandemic which started back in March, 2020 hasn't yet stopped in India, where the condition is deteriorating day by day. There are 300,000+ cases getting recorded everyday all over the country and hence the death toll is rising at a frightening pace. This is causing a massive shortage of available beds across the hospitals, a surge in COViD tests and a race to get the vaccine as soon as possible. On the other hand this also has taken a toll on all the healthcare workers, who are working day & night for the betterment of the people of India. They are overworked & tired by the end of the day; and hence cannot tend to every person that approaches them.</p>
							<p>Which is why we wanted to help the people of India by taking care of the daunting task of finding available Care Centers/ Hospitals/ Testing Centers & Vaccination Centers which are closest to them. By going to centers which are closer to them, people can, to some extent, reduce the spread of COViD-19. We also wanted to reduce the burden off of the doctors and hence created a vitual doctor with the help of Augmented Reality; which will help you in generic health related querries and problems as well as mental problems.</p>
							<p>By choosing one of the five locators on our website, users can quickly search for the type of centers which they want as opposed to waste time searching for every care center and then figuring out if it has the facility they need or not. These locators are created using MapMyIndia's 'Covid searches Widget'. This will definitely speed up the search and will help to save valuable time of the patient as well as their relatives. By clicking the Virtual Doctor link, the user can get the .apk for the app and go on to use the app that way. The Virtual Doctor is created using Unity Engine.</p>
